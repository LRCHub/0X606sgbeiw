[00:29.70] I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand
[00:35.23] Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
[00:40.73] Lose sensations, spare the insults leave them for another day
[00:46.28] I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away
[01:15.28] 
[01:25.87] It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand
[01:31.25] On the tenth floor, down the backstairs into no man's land
[01:37.19] Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now
[01:42.33] I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow
[02:10.83] 
[02:21.98] What means to you, what means to me and we will meet again
[02:27.46] I'm watching you, I watch it all, I take no pity from your friends
[02:33.15] Who is right, who can tell and who gives a damn right now?
[02:38.73] Until the spirit, new sensation takes hold, then you know
[03:07.23] 
[02:44.75] 'Til the spirit, new sensation takes hold, then you know
[02:50.54] 'Til the spirit, new sensation takes hold, then you know
[03:18.54] 
[02:58.00] I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
[03:03.56] I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling
[03:09.67] Feeling, feeling
[03:10.91] Feeling, feeling
[03:12.48] Feeling, feeling
[03:13.95] Feeling
